# The Assimp-Model-Database
The Asset-Importer-Lib model database - a collection of free models, links to commn model-databases, free or commercials, other importer libraries and model specifications. If you need to start working on a special format you can use this to find useful resources.

## The Model-Database
See https://github.com/assimp/assimp-mdb/tree/master/model-db/ to find the free models provided by us.

## The Model knowledge base

## List of awesome model importer libraries
- [The Asset-Importer-Lib](http://www.assimp.org/) - Open Asset Import Library (short name: Assimp) is a portable Open Source library to import various well-known 3D model formats in a uniform manner. The most recent version also knows how to export 3d files and is therefore suitable as a general-purpose 3D model converter.
- [OpenFBX](https://github.com/nem0/OpenFBX) - Lightweight open source FBX importer
- [FBX](https://github.com/jskorepa/fbx) - C++ Library for reading and writing FBX files
- [fbx](https://github.com/origamicomet/fbx) -  Single-file binary FBX importer.
- [StepCode](https://github.com/stepcode/stepcode) - STEPcode (formerly NIST's STEP Class Library) is used with IFC, STEP, and other standards that utilize the technologies of ISO10303 (STEP). It generates C++ and Python from EXPRESS (10303-11) schemas. The code is capable of reading and writing STEP Part 21 exchange files. It also utilizes Parts 22 and 23 (SDAI and its C++ binding). http://stepcode.org
- [TinyGLTF](https://github.com/syoyo/tinygltf) - Header only C++11 tiny glTF 2.0 library

## How to contribute
- Clone from this repository 
- Prepare a branch with your model in it. Place the model at the model-bd, select the name of the format in the folder and create another
  folder with the name of your model. If you want o share some special information abou the model add a readme-file.
- Create a pull-request
- After reviewing it we will add your model to the database and we will add your name to the CREDITS file.
